			   COMMAND SHELL
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.
Axel: ~20 hours
Jesper: ~20 hours

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.
We only worked together and used pair programming to finish the assignment, but 
in general Axel focused on program architecture and error handling and Jesper on pipes and 
the more general shell implementation.


			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any of the parts of it, too
>> easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?
It was quite hard, but since both of us had a lot of experience using UNIX
we felt quite comfortable with the task.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?
Especially writing to and reading from pipes, that was an aspect of the assignment
that was very interesting.

>> Were there any parts of the assignment that you felt were unnecessarily
>> tedious or pointless?
How to handle potential errors due to bad user input, that took us some time to understand.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?
No, not really. Emphasize the value of understanding UNIX systems.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the instructor and/or TAs to more
>> effectively assist students, either for future quarters or the remaining
>> projects?
No.

>> Any other comments?
No.
